# hobbyHTML

This is a repository for our Sprint 1, task 2. IN which we were tasked with creating a website about a hobby: golf.

The code consists of HTML5 filles and a CSS3 file. 

The site contains a home page, news page, shop page, activity page and signup page. Each page follows a fairly standard format (as it is styled from the same CSS). Pages consit of a header, a consitant navigation, a main and a footer. Pages may also contain sections, asides and article tags, depending on page content.
